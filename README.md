# Online-library-management-system-
Managing the library in online mode


In this project, we had deploy Online library management system on Microsoft Azure cloud virtual machine. Online Library Management System is an Automated Library System that handles the various functions of the library. It provides a complete solution to the library management software. The online Library Management System is classified into two parts Bar Code System and RFID System.
Library plays an important role in all schools and colleges, no educational institution can exist without Library Administration Software. It is an important part of every school and college and it helps the librarian to keep records of available books as well as issued books. Library Management System software helps in different ways by providing students the facility to learn, gather resources, promote group learning and improve knowledge and skills. In this project, we had used Microsoft azure services to protect our system from data lose due to technical or any machine failure & to protect our system from unknown or unauthentic user unless an until permission is given to them. To overcome this problems, we had used azure 2 service. 
They are follow as -
Backup & Disaster Recovery ( On Premises Backup )
Azure Firewall

1.Backup & Disaster Recovery ( On Premises Backup ) : 
Backup and disaster recovery involves periodically creating or updating one more copies of files, storing them in one or more remote locations, and using the copies to continue or resume business operations in the event of data loss due to file damage, data corruption, cyberattack or natural disaster.
The sub processes—'backup’ and ‘disaster recovery’—are sometimes mistaken for each other or for the entire process. Backup is the process of making the file copies. Disaster recovery is the plan and processes for using the copies to quickly reestablish access to applications, data, and IT resources after an outage. That plan might involve switching over to a redundant set of servers and storage systems until your primary data centre is functional again.
Simply having copies of data doesn’t mean a company can keep the business running. Ensuring business continuity requires robust and tested backup and disaster recovery plan. 


2. Azure Firewall  : 

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection. To learn what's east-west and north-south traffic, see East-west and north-south traffic.

Azure Firewall is offered in three SKUs: Standard, Premium, and Basic.
Azure Firewall Standard
Azure Firewall Standard provides L3-L7 filtering and threat intelligence feeds directly from Microsoft Cyber Security. Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains that are updated in real time to protect against new and emerging attacks.

Azure Firewall Premium
Azure Firewall Premium provides advanced capabilities include signature based IDPS to allow rapid detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns. These patterns can include byte sequences in network traffic or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware. There are more than 67,000 signatures in over 50 categories that are updated in real time to protect against new and emerging exploits. The exploit categories include malware, phishing, coin mining, and Trojan attacks.

Azure Firewall Basic
Azure Firewall Basic is intended for small and medium size (SMB) customers to secure their Azure cloud. environments. It provides the essential protection SMB customers need at an affordable price point.
